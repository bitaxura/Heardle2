- Dynamic UI updates for game state and feedback
- Fully responsive, clean, and modern interface

```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Spotify Developer Account
- Spotify Premium Account (required for playback)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heardle-2.git
   cd heardle-2
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:

   ```
   pip install spotipy python-dotenv
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
   CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
   PLAYLIST_ID=your_spotify_playlist_id
   ```

   - Get your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).

4. Fetch playlist tracks:

   ```
   python get_playlist.py
   ```

   This will generate a `tracks.json` file containing tracks from the specified playlist.

5. Open `index.html` in your browser to play the game.

6. You will also need to manually get an **OAuth token** for testing and paste it in `config.js`. Get the token [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/tutorials/getting-started#:~:text=Since%20this%20tutorial%20doesn%27t%20cover%20the%20authorization%20flow%2C%20we%20will%20provide%20your%20access%20token%20here%3A).

## How to Get a Spotify Playlist and Playlist ID

To use Heardle 2, you'll need to fetch tracks from a Spotify playlist. Here's how to create a playlist and get its ID:

### 1. Create or Choose a Playlist

* Go to [Spotify Web](https://open.spotify.com/) or use the Spotify desktop/mobile app.
* Create a new playlist or use an existing one.
* Add songs you'd like to use in your game.

### 2. Copy the Playlist Link

1. Open the playlist in Spotify.
2. Click the **three dots** (`...`) next to the playlist title or under the playlist name.
3. Hover over **Share**.
4. Click **Copy link to playlist**.

   Example link:

   ```
   https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M
   ```

### 3. Extract the Playlist ID

* The **Playlist ID** is the part after `/playlist/` and before any `?` or parameters.

  Example:

  ```
  Playlist link: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M?si=abc123
  Playlist ID:   37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M
  ```

### 3. Paste the Playlist ID in Your `.env` File

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```env
CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
PLAYLIST_ID=37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M
```

> Tip: Make sure the playlist is public or shared with your Spotify account to ensure it can be accessed by the API.

## Development Notes

### JavaScript (`main.js`)

- Loads playlist from `tracks.json`
- Plays snippets via Spotify Web Playback SDK
- Manages gameplay logic and user interactions

### Python Script (`get_playlist.py`)

- Fetches track data using the Spotify Web API
- Requires `.env` configuration for credentials

### Styling (`style.css`)

- Clean, mobile-friendly responsive design

## Environment Variables

Set these in your `.env` file:

- `CLIENT_ID`: Spotify API Client ID  
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: Spotify API Client Secret  
- `PLAYLIST_ID`: Spotify Playlist ID to fetch tracks from  

---

## Known Issues

- Spotify playback requires a **Premium** account.
- `config.js` uses a hardcoded token â€” in production, use dynamic token refreshing for security.
